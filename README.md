# Seattle Area Incident Avoidance

#### A mobile-friendly Website for general population incident avoidance

This is a University of Washington interdisciplinary Capstone project sponsored by Mobility Innovation Center, Challenge Seattle, WSDOT, King County Metro, and Sound Transit.

When traffic incidents occur in the Greater Seattle area, our sponsors relay important information through social 
media, traditional media, electronic roadway signs, and low-power radio stations along with some rare usage of 
mobile alert systems such as AlertSeattle. While these methods reach a broad group of road users, they do not provide adequate solutions in the form of real-time transit recommendations and 
updates. They are also not able to reach every consumer with specific information about incidents and the best 
course of action to take. Our sponsors are seeking recommendations for innovative solutions for wide-reaching 
notification of traffic incidents and solutions for transportation mode-shifting, departure time recommendations, 
and route shifts during and shortly after traffic incidents.

### Problem Statement 
*How might we innovate forms of transit incident reporting to the general public and provide accessible, 
mobile solutions for their needs in a timely manner?*

### Goals
Our goal is to create an innovative solution that can help the general public navigate or avoid major incidents 
and related congestion. When a major incident or multiple major incidents occur, our solution will provide a 
platform where users can be informed of congestion information, departure time shifts, routing recommendations, 
and support for transportation mode shifting. It is developed with assumptions of the ongoing development of a 
Traffic Incident Management - Congestion Management "Virtual Command Center"

We identified two areas of importance that we focus on for this project: 
1. How user groups can better access or take advantage of current ticketing apps through marketing, 
partnerships, incentives, etc?
2. Recommend design guidelines Metro should consider requiring for future mobile ticketing apps.
    - Promptly informing the general population of incidents which impact their commute
    - Behavior change and modeshift behavior reinforcement

### Overview
Our solution is an interactive, mobile-friendly website which will be hosted on one of the transit agency’s servers. If an incident happens, the server will be activated and the website link will appear active on the official website of King County Metro (KCM), Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), and Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT), Sound Transit, as well as any other relevant transit agencies. The link would also be sent to Alert Seattle customers as well as those who subscribe to KCM, Sound Transit and WSDOT text alerts directing them to the website.

### Instructions to use your GoogleMap API key
- Get your own key [here (Get Google API Key)](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
- And then, in `test-map/docs/index.html`, substitute `replacekey` in the code below with the API key you got from the previous step.
  ```
  <script  id="google" async defer
           src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=replacekey&callback=initMap"
  async defer></script>
